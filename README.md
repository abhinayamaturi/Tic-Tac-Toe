This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The game allows two players to compete by taking turns to mark spaces on a 3x3 grid with "X" or "O". 
The first player to align three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
